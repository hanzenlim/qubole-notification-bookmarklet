#Qubole bookmarklet	
Listends to qubole api (https://api.qubole.com) for job status and notfies you when job is done

##Use Case:
A typical qubole job takes some time to run the query and we usually don't stare at it and wait for it to finish 
but instead we switch contexts and do some other work. With this bookmarklet, you can attach a listener
to the job and will alert you when the job is done. 

##Usage:
Click on the qubole bookmarklet and it will start listening the current job
